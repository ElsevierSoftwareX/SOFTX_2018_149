All written functions are excessively explained by comments in the source code. Therefore, no source code documentation will be given here. In the folder 'classes', you can find the core libraries of the software bundle. The cp algrorithm \cite{Zienert2018} is implemented in 'classes/class\_debye.py'. The other three classes 'classes/class\_consts.py', 'classes/class\_datafile.py' and 'classes/class\_math\_helpers.py' defining sets of helper functions for dealing with experimental datafiles and doing certain mathematical calculations.

The 'examples' folder includes ready-to-use examples of how to use the core functions of \emph{cp-tools}, especially how to call the cp-predicting algorithm. The folder 'scripts' bundles a set of helpful scripts that can be used to evaluate experimental data.

In this guide, the aim and usage of the scripts within the 'examples' and 'scripts' folders will be explained in detail.
