The software bundle \emph{cp-tools} is a set of Python classes and scripts that help to derive the thermophysical properties $c_p$, $\alpha$, $V$ and $B$ as function of temperature according to the algorithm described by Zienert and Fabrichnaya (2018)\cite{Zienert2018}. In addition, several scripts are provided that can be used to extract necessary data from experimental datafiles.
