  abstract  = {The theoretically predicted linear correlation between the volume coefficient of thermal expansion and the thermal heat capacity was investigated for highly symmetrical atomic arrangements. Normalizing the data on these thermodynamic parameters to the Debye temperature gives practically identical curves from zero kelvins to the Debye temperature. This result is consistent with the predicted linear correlation. At temperatures higher than the Debye temperature the normalized values of the thermal expansion are always higher than the normalized value of the heat capacity. The correlation detected has significant computational advantage since it allows calculating the volume coefficient of thermal expansion from one experimental value by using the Debye function. },
