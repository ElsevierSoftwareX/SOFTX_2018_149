\section{fit-TD-from-heat-capacity.py}
The script \emph{fit-TD-from-heat-capacity.py} calculates the Debye temperature from a least-square fit of the Debye equation to experimental $c_p$ values.\\

\textbf{CALL}: \emph{python scripts/fit-TD-from-heat-capacity.py DATAFILE}\\

The DATAFILE must contain tab-separated values of $T$ and $c_p$. An example file can be found for silver in 'example-datafiles/data-Ag-cp-Furukawa1972.data'.

The script will ask for the highest temperature that should be used for fitting. For best results, choose a temperature where $c_p\approx c_V$ is fulfilled. If your $c_p$ values are from a multiphase sample, you can also give the mole fraction of each additional phase and its Debye temperature. Press ENTER if you do not want to add a further phase for calculation.
