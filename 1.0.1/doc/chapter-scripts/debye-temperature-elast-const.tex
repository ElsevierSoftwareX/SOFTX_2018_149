\section{debye-temperature-elast-const.py}
The script \emph{debye-temperature-elast-const.py} calculates the Debye temperature based on zero-Kelvin properties using the relations given by Debye (1912) \cite{Debye1912} and by Anderson (1963) \cite{Anderson1963}.\\

\textbf{CALL}: \emph{python scripts/debye-temperature-elast-const.py}\\

The script will ask for the molar mass, number of atoms per formular unit, density, Poisson number and the bulk modulus. The calculated Debye temperatures and the value of the specific energy will be printed on the screen.
